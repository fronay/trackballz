# -- Mini milestones so far:
1. Table color removal based on fixed color -> pre-segments ball positions 
2. Find table color for removal
3. Rough coords/ bounding circle for balls based on distance transform

# -- Milestones to come:
*Code-clean-up:
	Integrate color removal & ball bounding functions in new main function
*Automatise/ make more robust:
	Find ball radius (from modal circular-blob radius)
*Rudimentary ball identification:
	Take color histogram of each bounding box -> assign initial color identity
*Video integration
	Check timing in loop
	Create "memory" object for individual balls
